//1.The starting probability distributions over the latent
//classes for each user (Ï€).
	//Initialize an ArrayList with the starting length of k (where k is the number of states). 
	//Fill in counts of users who start in each state. 
	//? How do I assign initial states ?
	
//2. The transition probability table between classes in adjacent time periods (A). 
	//Create forwards and backwards state moving methods and call based on probability of state change
	//? How do I determine when to change states ?
	
//3. The emission or observation model that generates the
//data from the latent class memberships in each time
//period


//Optimization Step
//Maximization/M-step: The parameters are calculated
//such that, for a given distribution over the hidden variables,
//the expected log likelihood of the parameters is
//maximized.
